# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Starter code was provided by [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) (see [starter code](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter.git)). Back-end includes Node, Express and MongoDB but only the front-end was modified using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX. It went from a single one like HTML text to what you see.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- Chance
- Body-parser

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
3. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.
4. Add new tweet by clicking on *write a new tweet* in the navigation bar.
5. Scroll up or down to see saved tweets.
